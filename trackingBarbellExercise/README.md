This is a ML project that can classify different barbell exercises and keep track of how many reps you do. It uses data from motion sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes. This work is motivated by Dave Ebbelaar's work "Exploring the Possibilities of Context-Aware Applications for Strength Training"
